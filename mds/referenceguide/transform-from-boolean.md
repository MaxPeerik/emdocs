Transformer with multiple options for converting boolean values.

Selecting <b>custom XPath</b> allows you to fully control the transformation of any value by entering your own custom XPath expression to handle the conversion. Technically, the XPath you enter will be used for the <code>&lt;xsl:value-of&gt;</code> statement in the generated stylesheet. Use the <i>view XSLT</i> button to see a preview of how your XPath will be embedded in the resulting XSLT.

### 
Allows you to fully control the transformation of an attribute value by specifying custom XPath.

You can use the token [%previousOutput%] to refer to the previous generated XPath and use it in the current transformer, e.g. <b>if ([%previousOutput%]!='') then [%previousOutput%] else 'test' </b>

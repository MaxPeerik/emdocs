#### System
The system this code is specified for.

<i>Required</i>

#### Code type
The code type of this system code.

<i>Required</i>

#### CDM code
The CDM code this system code is mapped to.

<i>Required</i>

#### System code
Unique value for this system code.

This value needs to match exactly the value used in the calls to the mapping web services that are made from eMagiz message flows.

<i>Required</i>

#### Primary (CDM > system)
Whether this system code is the primary (CDM > system) code or not.

Because multiple system codes can be mapped to multiple CDM codes (many-to-many), one of them must be flagged as <i>primary (CDM > system)</i>. When a message flow needs to map a CDM code to a system code, this <i>primary (CDM > system) code</i> will be selected.

#### Primary (system > CDM)
Whether this system code is the primary (system > CDM) code or not.

Because multiple system codes can be mapped to multiple CDM codes (many-to-many), one of them must be flagged as <i>primary (system > CDM)</i>. When a message flow needs to map a system code to a CDM code, this <i>primary (system > CDM) code</i> will be selected.

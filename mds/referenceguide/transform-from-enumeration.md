### 
Transformer with multiple options for converting enumeration values.

Option <b>Value mapping</b> allows you to set for each value of the source enumeration a corresponding destination value. This option is only available when the source and destination attributes have the data type  <i>enumeration</i>. Note that source and destination values are defined in your source and destination XML message definitions.

Selecting <b>custom XPath</b> allows you to fully control the transformation of any value by entering your own custom XPath expression to handle the conversion. Technically, the XPath you enter will be used for the <code>&lt;xsl:value-of&gt;</code> statement in the generated stylesheet. Use the <i>view XSLT</i> button to see a preview of how your XPath will be embedded in the resulting XSLT


### 
This value will be used if the source value does not match any of the existing value mappings. If no value is defined, it will be set automatically to empty string.

Allows you to fully control the transformation of an attribute value by specifying custom XPath.

You can use the token [%previousOutput%] to refer to the previous generated XPath and use it in the current transformer, e.g. <b>if ([%previousOutput%]!='') then [%previousOutput%] else 'test' </b>

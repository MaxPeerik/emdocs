#### Filters out source entities that do not meet the specified condition.


This operation will apply the mapping only for source entities that meet a certain condition.

If the option <b>by attribute</b> is selected, a condition will be created based on the selected source attribute and logical operator. Currently, string, enumeration, and numeric operators are supported.

If the <b>XPath</b> option is selected, the filter is created based on the XPath expression value. Technically, the XPath you enter will be used as the predicate of the <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> call in the generated stylesheet. Use the <i>view XSLT</i> button to see a preview how your XPath will be embedded in the resulting XSLT.

### 
Enter the value to compare against. For string comparison, this can be left empty to compare against the empty string ''. For numeric comparison, this field is  required.

### 
Select the enumeration value to compare against. Leave empty to compare against the empty string ''.

## New features
- The responses of the "subsystem:list" command are now significantly smaller, increasing the responsiveness of the runtime dashboard when the infra flow is using build 35 (or higher).
## Minor changes
- Updated bundle 'com.emagiz.components.control' from 7.0.0 to 7.1.0
- Removed bundle 'com.sun.mail.javax.mail' 1.5.6 (now packaged with runtime)

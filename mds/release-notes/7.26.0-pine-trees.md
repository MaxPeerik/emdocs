Release that provides tags and filtering in the Architecture Design. In addition, this release includes several other improvements and tackles some minor issues.
## New features
- Design: Tagging and filtering are available in the Architecture, similar to the other visualizations of the bus.
## Minor changes
- A JavaScript library used cross the portal, jQuery, has been updated to fix a potential security vulnerability.
- Message definitions and transformations: data types with custom restrictions now have a visual indication in the message tree. Square brackets [] surrounding the XSD data type indicate that an attribute has custom restrictions. Hovering over the attribute shows a summary of these restrictions.
- Create: From the flow designer it is possible to create a deployment package when not in editing mode, by pressing Deploy in the right bottom of the screen
- Slightly improved performance of visualizations of the bus across the portal.
- CDM and message designer: Several actions that impact (much) more than what is visible in the current screen will now provide a warning first.
- Message definitions: If a message does not have a root yet, you can now use the (+) to add one.
- The styling of the context menu (right mouse button) in our widgets has been changed to better match the look and feel of the other user interface elements.
## Bug fixes
- Create: Restrictions in the message definitions have better validations (#317220, 317230)
- Transformations: Static copies can now only be added to the original entities, to avoid copies of copies misbehaving. For example, it would not be possible to delete attribute rules from them.
- Message definitions: Fixed that importing XSDs with simple content using multiple inheritance did not work correctly.
- Manage: When creating new alert triggers, the monitored objects, such as JMS queues, can be selected without having to save the trigger first.
- Cloud: When removing a JMS server, and adding it back immediately, the firewall rules are set correctly.
- Community: Several links in the documentation have been fixed. The XML Schemas for several eMagiz components are now available from the Store.
- Capture: Fixed that it was not possible to cancel while on the screen to add a new message type to an integration. In addition, a new message type will now be automatically selected when created from a new integration. (#314393)
- Transformations: Fixed that, in a specific case, entity rules would remain in Create after they were removed from Design. This would leave the transformation impossible to be opened.
- Create: The order of fields can be switched again in EDI Mappings
- Message definitions: Fixed that importing an XSD with multiple root elements would result in undesired behaviour in Create when drawing entity rules incorrectly in Design. (#319299)

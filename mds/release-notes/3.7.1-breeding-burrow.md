First maintenance release in the eMagiz 3.7.x line.
## New features
- Added MIME message to XML transformer: a transformer that can convert incoming e-mail MIME messages to XML format (the same format as the input of the XML to MIME message transformer).
## Minor changes
- Added new properties use unsynchronized appender and send timeout to log appender channel adapter, giving more control over timing/multi-threading issues.
- Added new properties depends on and destroy method to HornetQ connection factory, enabling the user to specify startup/shutdown dependencies.
- Property static connectors of HornetQ cluster is now optional, making it possible to define "chain clusters".
- Log appender channel adapter will now test the logging message flow by sending a test message during startup: if this message is not handled correctly an exception is thrown and the appender will not start. If during normal operation a message can't be send, this appender will now shutdown automatically to prevent any cascading failures.

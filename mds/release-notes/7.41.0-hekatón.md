Release that introduces a deployment plan in the Deploy phase of the ILM. Next to that, several expert-level features have been added in the flow designer. Furthermore, new documentation is available in Github. In addition, this release includes several other improvements and tackles some minor issues.
## New features
- Create - Flow designer: Added a new feature to web services components, allowing you to publish WS-Security web services for specific cases. Please be aware that most web services can be secured properly without the use of this expert-level component.
- Deploy - Releases: A deployment plan can be made. It contains the steps that should be executed for each deployment. This serves as guidance for anyone who needs to deploy (parts of) the bus, so that they know what has to be done when, without forgetting any steps. Currently, this is a simple list of actions that have to be taken manually. In the future, this can be extended with several types of automated steps.
- Documentation: Additional documentation is available through GitHub. In the main menu, go to Community, Documentation, then click the link at the top. In the future, the documentation will be embedded in the portal, and more information will be added. Please feel free to help improve the documentation by making a pull request or raising issues in GitHub.
## Major changes
- Create - Flow designer: Updated Job component with
  - a new item processor, called Column map to string array converter, to support using the OData item reader and Redshift item writer in a single step of a job.
  - the Redshift item writer supports data merging using staging tables, to efficiently add new data to an existing table by using a combination of updates and inserts.
## Minor changes
- Across the portal, several minor improvements to (help) texts have been made. (#406916)
- Deploy - Cloud: After resizing a cloud VM, the pop-up is closed, to avoid accidental cancelling. (#409187)
- Deploy - Releases: When installing a releases, a download option is offered for the eMagiz-Mendix connectors in the release. From the packages screen, it is still possible to download emc-files for individual flows by selecting one or more of them, and pressing "Install". In addition, the packages screen has an option to download them packaged per container as well. (#406615)
- Deploy - Releases: The name of a new release is not pre-filled, to encourage more meaningful names.
- Deploy - Releases: Improved performance of loading the releases.
- Create - Flow designer: Channels that are not "Direct" but "Queued" have icons on them, to easily identify which type they are. In almost no current flows, will you notice this change, as channels are "Direct" normally.
- Deploy - Releases: Improved the way removing exit/entry-connectors from a release works.
## Bug fixes
- Deploy - Releases: Zooming in and out works as expected. (#394377)
- Bus dashboard: Using the links in the page leads to the same result as using the menu. (#407841, 404982)
- Create - Transformations: When adding actions on mapping lines, they show up without having to refresh (previously hotfixed). (#407613, 408505, 407248)
- Deploy - Releases: Having many releases, no longer should lead to an error "Failed to Fetch" (previously hotfixed). (#406119)
- Create - Flow designer: Blocked the Deploy shortcut when you do not have rights to deploy in the Test environment. (#408903)
## Known issues
- Create - Store: Importing flows from the store requires an extra refresh of the browser page for now. After importing a flow, you will not be directed to it immediately, but instead will get a warning pop-up. It will instruct you to refresh the browser, after which you will be able to use the flow as you would normally. Not refreshing will lead to unexpected behaviour.
- Create - eMagiz-Mendix connector: Opening eMagiz-Mendix connector flows the first time may result in an empty screen. The workaround is to go back to Create and open them a second time.

Release that provides a revamped view of the (Cloud) Architecture in the Design phase of the ILM. In addition, this release includes several other improvements and tackles some minor issues.
## Major changes
- Design - (Cloud) Architecture: Enabled a completely re-engineered view on your architecture. This view provides better insight into (recommended) sizing of machines. The Architecture will become leading for (cloud) deployments, so check your setup in Design, and update it if it does not match your current deployment.
## Minor changes
- Create - Flow designer: Support components for Data Pipelines highlight when other components that use them are selected.
- Across the portal several (help) texts have been improved.
- Design - Solution design: Removed the Process container(s) and JMS server(s) from the Solution design view, as they were redundant with the Architecture view.
- Deploy - Releases: Changing the version of a flow in a release shows the current version in bold in the drop down of available versions.
## Bug fixes
- Design - CDM Messages: For synchronous flows, fixed a bug that made it hard to open the response message correctly.

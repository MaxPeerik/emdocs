Release that introduces a graphical representation of the topology of a bus (clustering, fail-over, containers) in the design phase of the Integration Lifecycle Management (ILM). Both this topology and other graphical representations of the bus can be exported as images now. In addition, this release includes several small improvements and tackles some minor issues.

Please note that several screens in the deploy and manage phases of the ILM have been prepared with tabs for Testing/Acceptance/Production environment support. For now, only the Production tab should be used on my.emagiz.com and the Testing and Acceptance tabs on my-accp.emagiz.com.
## New features
- Topology: A graphical representation shows the "topology" of a bus in the design phase of the ILM. This includes such things as clusters, fail-over, and the number of process containers. It can be accessed from the Deployment container tab of a message bus.
## Major changes
- Testing, Acceptance, and Production tabs on pages in the Deploy and Manage phases of the ILM.
- Improved support for opening the flows in the flow designer in multiple tabs in the same browser. (#87234)
- Added "Export to image" buttons to the graphical representations of requirements, message buses, and the topology. (#151423, 151416)
## Minor changes
- In the graphical representation of the requirements, the integrations going out of the systems in to eMagiz are at the top.
- Added a button to view the XML-schema for a eMagiz Mendix connector in read-only mode.
- Added multi-select to batch change the status of alerts. (#149647)
- Added a confirmation pop-up when removing resources from a message bus. (#124988)
- For administrators, in user management, the list of users shows only active users by default. Inactive users can be seen by changing the search settings. (#153139)
## Bug fixes
- Fixed the bug where adding a component in the flow designer and pressing cancel made the component not editable any more. (#149397, 150927, 153818)
- Fixed the bug with the graphical representations where the tooltip remained after double-clicking a box. (#140182, 139849)
- Fixed the bug in the graphical representation where the white arrow in the connectors was not clickable.
- Fixed the bug where a grid showing flows would occasionally break down after somebody else changed a flow.

First maintenance release in the eMagiz 3.11.x line.
## New features
- Added support to the Mendix runtime modules for tunneling HornetQ connections through a Mendix 'RequestHandler': this can be useful in scenarios where you deploy HornetQ in a Mendix application and want to re-use the existing Mendix HTTP(S) port for the connections.
## Minor changes
- ThClient settings 'database', 'username' and 'password' are now no longer specified as configuration options, but as message headers.
- Added support for handling deleted records to the ThClient connector.
## Bug fixes
- Fixed some issues with the ThClient 'readChanges' functionality.

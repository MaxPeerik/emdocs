First maintenance release in the eMagiz 3.20.x line.
## Minor changes
- Added support to HornetQ servers for specifying security settings per queue/topic.
- Added a utility class that can be used in SpEL expressions to help implement security managers using the new 'HornetQ security manager gateway'.
- Added some "dummy classes" to make this eMagiz runtime forward compatible with future versions of the OSGi runtime.
- Added aliases for certain build-in properties to make this eMagiz runtime forward compatible with future versions of the OSGi runtime:
  - 'emagiz.runtime.name' (alias for part of the 'emagiz.jvm.name' property value)
  - 'emagiz.runtime.environment' (alias for part of the 'emagiz.jvm.name' property value)
  - 'emagiz.ws.url' (alias for the 'emagiz.saas.ws.url' property)
  - 'emagiz.customer.username' (alias for the 'emagiz.saas.ws.username' property)
  - 'emagiz.customer.password' (alias for the 'emagiz.saas.ws.password' property)
## Bug fixes
- Fixed an error that occurred when deploying a HornetQ server with a custom security manager.

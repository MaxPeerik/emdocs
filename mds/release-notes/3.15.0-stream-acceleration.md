Release improving the support for enriching XML messages with data obtained from another source.
## New features
- Added the 'XSLT extension gateway': this component can be called from an XSLT transformer by using the new 'ezx:call-xslt-extension-gateway(...)' function. This allows users to model how and where to obtain the data needed for enriching their XML messages, using the 'normal' eMagiz flow components they are already familiar with.
  - Note that currently it is only possible to use this new functionality if you manually create the XSLT. In a next release of eMagiz, this process will be fully supported by the designer.
## Minor changes
- Added an 'update' button to the eMagiz Mendix runtime, allowing users to update an existing configuration with a newer version. (Previously, you had to delete the old configuration, import the newer version and redo the settings.)
## Bug fixes
- In the eMagiz Mendix runtime, the 'auto-load all' and 'unload all' actions now run asynchronously in order to prevent time-out errors.

Release adding flat file and large XML file support, and some other small additions/changes.
## New features
- inbound adapter added for reading items from (large) flat files (delimited and fixed length) or XML files and converting them to multiple (XML) messages, using the flat file and XML file support from the Spring Batch project
- support added for '_NULL' suffix in names of properties and constructor arguments when mapping configurations from Mendix to XML: this results in or being generated in the XML when the value is 'empty', instead of skipping the property
- it is now possible to use the 'nullChannel' in Iris configurations
- added support for Metacom web service authentication
## Minor changes
- update to Spring Integration 2.0.3
## Bug fixes
- underscores in bean property names and Mendix association names are no longer replaced with a hyphen character when exporting configurations from Mendix to XML (this resulted in illegal names)
## Known issues
- see 1.0.0

Product renamed to eMagiz and libraries updated to newest stable releases.
## New features
- Renamed to eMagiz (formerly Iris); this change has the following impact when migrating from a previous version:
- old license files are not compatible
- old configuration files cannot be used, unless you change (find + replace) the following in the XML configuration:
- replace "
- replace "Iris_" with "EMagiz_"
- replace "nl.capesystemsintegration.iris" with "com.emagiz"
- replace "nl/capesystemsintegration/iris/" with "com/emagiz/"
- replace "iris-" with "emagiz-"
- replace "http://www.capesystemsintegration.nl/ns/iris/" with "http://www.emagiz.com/ns/"
- replace "org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler" with "com.emagiz.components.http.ServletHandlerFactory"
- the namespaces of XML messages have changed, so check your XSLTs and/or Mendix XML mappings; the new namespaces can be found here
- while unsupported, in previous versions it was sometimes possible to run configurations designed in a new Iris version using an older runtime version ("forwards compatible"): this is certainly not possible between version 3.0.0 and all previous releases
- New license option to allow only encrypted resources (XSLTs, XSDs, etc) to be used by a message flow, to prevent tampering with deployed applications
## Minor changes
- Customer name (eMagiz PAAS) must now be unique per partner
- Improvements of forms, validations and help/documentation in the design time
- Library updates
- Update to Spring Framework 3.0.6
- Update to Saxon 9.3.0.5
- Update to Smack API 3.2.1
- Update to Woodstox 4.1.2
- Update to Joda Time 2.0.0
- Update to Apache Common Net 3.0.1
- Update to SLF4J 1.6.2
- Update to Jetty 7.5.1
- Update to WinRun4J 0.4.3
- Update to XOM 1.2.7
- Removed any dependencies on the Logging module from all eMagiz modules
## Bug fixes
- Re-added support for properties XSLT param headers and XSLT parameters to the XSLT transformer: these properties were added in version 2.0.1, but were somehow lost in 2.1.0
- Fixed runtime class loading issues with microflow invoking message consumer and XML mapping message consumer when running in Mendix 3.0
## Known issues
- When running eMagiz in Mendix 3.0, it is not possible to use pass payload as path of the microflow invoking message consumer. The reason this no longer works is that Mendix removed the support for it in 3.0: it will be back in a future version however. In the meantime if you need this feature in your project, don't migrate to Mendix 3.0 but keep using a 2.5 release.

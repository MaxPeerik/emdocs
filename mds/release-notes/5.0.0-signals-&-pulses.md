# Runtime release notes
Release with retry behaviour, support for UTF with BOM, HTTPS web service hosting, new JMS features and library/technology updates.
## New features
- Added support for configuration of sophisticated retry scenarios on nearly all flow endpoints using the Spring Retry project.
- Added support for the following custom character encodings: (##46059)
  - x-UTF-8-BOM (eight-bit Unicode Transformation Format, with byte-order mark)
  - x-UTF-16BE-BOM (sixteen-bit Unicode Transformation Format, big-endian byte order, with byte-order mark)
- Added support for SSL select channel selector to Jetty Web Server, enabling hosting of web services using the HTTPS protocol. Also supports 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual authentication).
- New features added to the JMS messaging infrastructure layer:
  - failover using replication is now supported in addition to failover using a shared-store
  - message redelivery can now be configured to use an exponentially increasing delay between attempts
  - 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual authentication) is now supported for securing connections between servers and clients
  - the local address/port used by clients when creating outgoing connections to JMS servers can now be explicitly set, which can be useful to solve firewall issues in specific deployment scenarios
  - this new version is backwards compatible with the previous version, but not forwards compatible: this means that old JMS clients can still connect to new JMS servers, but new JMS clients cannot connect to old JMS servers
- Added functionality to Mendix 3 & 4 runtime modules for delayed auto-loading of configurations (#48315); see the documentation of the new constant EMagiz_Runtime.AutoLoadDelay on how to enable this. Auto-loading configurations with a delay can be useful in cases where Mendix must be fully started before loading the eMagiz flows, for example when an eMagiz message flow calls a web service hosted in the same Mendix runtime. (##48315)

# Portal release notes
Release with retry behaviour, support for UTF with BOM, HTTPS web service hosting, new JMS features and library/technology updates.
## New features
Added support for customers to manage their own flows. This will have to be enabled separatly per customer and customer employee.
Added XML definition module:
With the new XML definition module it becomes possible to create a graphical representation of your XML schema. You can create a new definition under the resources tab.
XML mapping module :
The XML mapping module allows you to map different schema's, resulting in a transformation from one xml message into another. You can create a new mapping under the resources tab.
Added support for exporting separate flows as deployment package
Non bus flows can now be copied in the designer overview.
Flow designer:
Added a context menu when right-clicking on endpoints.
Added possibility to flip endpoints horizontally.
Mobile:
Added a mobile monitoring dashboard, that allows customers to monitor their JVM's live on their mobile phone. The dashboard can be found on https://my.emagiz.com/index-mobile.html

   - HornetQ connection factory:
    - Added new property call failover timeout
- Added new property message tracking security by systems to customers.
- Added export to csv button on the error log overview (#43232) (##43232)
- We will now warn you when you try to create an employee for a customer with concurrent users set to 0. (#43508) (##43508)
- Flowdesigner:
  - Added possibility to connect channels to router components by means of drag and drop.
  - Added error channel icon to inbound channel adapters.
- Added a new feedback widget allowing you to directly create and upload a screenshot.
## Bug fixes
- Fixed a security issue that prevented saving changes to customer employees (#43586) (##43586)
- Channels that are not connected to any object should no longer be invisible. (#24432) (##24432)
- Endpoints should no longer increase in size when dropping them on top of another endopoint (#25752) (##25752)
- Fixed an issue that kept error messages in the error console eventhough these were solved.(#38884) (##38884)
- Fixed a bug that caused javascript to loop infinitly.
- Added a refresh on load to the component list tab, which causes it to update if components are created from the flow designer. (#37529) (##37529)
- Fixed an issue with the flat-file-to-xml-transformer that did not remove white spaces correctly from the name/column fields (#41128) (##41128)
## Known issues
- Removing flows with definitions is not possible due to an security bug. A work arround is to remove the resources of this flow separatly and then remove the flow.
- Copying flows will currently not copy the used mappings or transformations, these will have to be recreated/imported to add them to your copy.
- Mobile users are not properly redirected to index-mobile.html, to visit the mobile dashboard please go to the url directly https://my.emagiz.com/index-mobile.html.

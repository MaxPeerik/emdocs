Release adding the BouncyCastle cryptography library to the eMagiz runtime. This is a requirement when you want to use the new S/MIME transformers, but in all other cases there is no need to update existing runtimes to this version.
## Minor changes
- Added Java library BouncyCastle v1.56 to the runtime as an extension library.
- Added Java library "javax.mail" v1.5.6 to the runtime as an endorsed library.
- Added default timeouts when setting up a connection with java. The default was unlimited which might cause issues when no response will ever be received.

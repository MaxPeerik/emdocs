Release with support for connecting to 'ThClient' databases, and library/technology updates.
## New features
- Added new support object ThClient connector for connecting to 'ThClient' databases through thclient.dll using Java Native Access. This support object can be used by the following two new service activators:
  - ThClient table reading activator: reads all the records of database tables, for example to synchronize the data to another application
  - ThClient changes reading activator: reads only the changed records of a database (by using the log table), for example to keep another application synchronized real-time

## Bug fixes
- Fixed an issue during the export process where empty reference sets in the configuration were not ignored, which could cause some default property values to be overwritten (most notably the default endpoint exception resolvers of a web service message dispatcher).
- Completely removed all traces of languages other than English (US) from the eMagiz Mendix runtime modules, because these (unsupported) languages could cause errors in the Mendix project when that project happened to have one of these languages enabled. To quickly add translations back in your project, use the Tools > Language Operations option in the Mendix modeler and copy the English (US) translations to your desired language (and then translate labels as you see fit, but usually the eMagiz GUI is only visible to an administrator user).

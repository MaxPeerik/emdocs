Release adding SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) support and improving the existing file-polling options.
## New features
- Support for transferring messages using SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), similar to the existing FTP(S) support.
  - New component 'SFTP inbound channel adapter': creates messages by polling a remote SFTP directory
  - New component 'SFTP outbound channel adapter': sends messages to a remote SFTP directory
  - New support object 'default SFTP (caching) session factory': creates (and reuses) connections to remote SFTP servers
  - New support object 'SFTP composite file list filter': provides advanced filtering options to determine which files to process and which files to ignore
- Added new file filtering options that are available when polling for local files, FTP(S) files and SFTP files. (#56297)
  - Age file list filter: only accepts files with an age within the specified limits
  - Regular files only file list filter: only accepts regular files, not directories or symbolic links (#107963)
  - Size file list filter: only accepts files with a size within the specified limits (#9122)
- When polling for local files, you can now also recursively scan all subdirectories inside the target directory. To enable this behaviour, add the new support object 'recursive leaf-only directory scanner' to your flow and use this in your file inbound channel adapter. Please read the help texts of these components for performance considerations. (#48107)

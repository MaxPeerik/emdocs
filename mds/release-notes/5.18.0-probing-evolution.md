  - Basic access authentication
  - Microsoft Azure Storage Services authentication
  
# Portal release notes (5.18.0)
Release with various improvements and fixes.
## Minor changes
- Improved the help texts of the JDBC components, better explaining how to use values from the message content in SQL queries. (#114290)
- When importing XML schema's, there is now a limit on the maximum recursion depth. This prevents issues where importing XML schema's with circular references got the importer "stuck".
## Bug fixes
- Fixed some cases where exported resources were using incorrect file names. (#115981, 115915)
- Fixed an issue in the XML definition editor where during export, attributes could end up in the wrong section of the XSD, making the XML schema invalid. (#115889)
- Corrected a visual bug where attributes were displayed twice when using the XML definition editor in read-only mode. (#115682)

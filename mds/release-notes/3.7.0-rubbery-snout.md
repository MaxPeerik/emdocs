Release with JDBC stored procedure and Ehcache support, new mapping features, flow designer improvements and library/technology updates.
## New features
- Extended the JDBC components by adding support for stored procedures:
  - added JDBC stored procedure inbound channel adapter: polls a database by calling a stored procedure (or function), and generates messages from the result
  - added JDBC stored procedure outbound channel adapter: sends messages to a database by calling a stored procedure
  - added JDBC stored procedure outbound gateway: sends messages to a database by calling a stored procedure (or function), and generates messages from the result
  - extended JDBC result set to XML transformer to correctly handle result sets from stored procudures
- Extended the caching support by adding Ehcache as one of the implementations. Using Ehcache, the following caching features are now available:
  - configurable maximum memory usage per cache, and the option to overflow to disk when that maximum is reached
  - configurable cache expiry policies, based on time-to-live or time-to-idle of elements
  - configurable cache eviction policies: LRU (least recently used), LFU (less frequently used) and FIFO (first in, first out)
  - persistent disk store which stores cache data between JVM restarts
- Extended the functionality of eMagiz mappings:
  - added support for custom attributes: these are user-defined attributes on the code type level, that can be given a value on the CMD code level; these custom attributes values can then be retrieved from XSLTs using the new mapping:lookup-custom-attribute(...) function
  - added explicit support for many-to-many code mappings; see the new primary (CDM > system) and primary (system > CDM) properties in the system codes overview
  - added a web service interface that provides administrative operations for the mapping module (see acceptance WSDL and production WSDL); using this web service interface, applications can automatically keep mappings up-to-date without requiring user interaction in the flow manager
- It is now possible in the flow designer to reconnect channels to a different component by using drag and drop, making it much easier to change an existing message flow.
## Minor changes
- In the XML to flat file transformer, it is now possible to enter special characters into the line separator and field separator fields (see the help texts of those fields for the correct syntax). This enables users to enter a "Windows enter" into the line separator field, for example. (#31986) (##31986)
- The HTTP request address extracting interceptor now also adds the emagiz_ws_forwardedFor message header, containing the value of the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header of the incoming web service request (if any). This can be useful for tracing the origin of incoming web service requests that are forwarded by proxies/firewalls. (#30813) (##30813)
- During shutdown of the eMagiz runtime, configurations are now unloaded in the reverse order of loading. This could resolve some errors during unloading if the configurations have dependencies on each other and the (correct) loading order is important.
- When deleting an object in the flow designer, you no longer have to double click an empty spot on the canvas first.
- The tree containing the components in the flow designer now contains an addional level, making it easier to find components. (#25725) (##25725)

## Known issues
- Changing the channel connections in the flow designer using the new drag and drop functionality and then cancelling the changes does not restore the previous state of that channel connection properly.

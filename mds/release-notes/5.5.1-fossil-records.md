# Runtime release notes
Second maintenance release in the eMagiz 3.11.x line.
## Minor changes
- Changes and improvements to the ThClient connector
  - Negative date values are now treated as being 'empty'
  - Character encoding used by 'thclient.dll' to convert string values is now configurable
  - Performance of the 'readTable' operation when reading from large tables is improved; as a consequence, this operation now uses 'lastIndex' instead of 'nextOffset' (similar to the 'readChanges' operation)
  - Multi-column indices are now supported
## Bug fixes
- Fixed runtime exception "net.sf.saxon.trans.XPathException: Saxon can only handle a StAXSource that wraps an XMLStreamReader" when using the file item reader message source to read XML fragments

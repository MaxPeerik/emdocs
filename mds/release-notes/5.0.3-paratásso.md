Third maintenance release in the eMagiz 5.0.x line. This release fixes several startup and shutdown related issues.
## Bug fixes
- The lock file is now stored in the data directory. This enables proper EFS locking in the AWS cloud.
- A datadir revision file is introduced. This can be used to identify differences between (versions of) data directories and the runtimes using it.
- Fixed the issue where, in specific cases, having two versions of the same flow might cause auto-startup to skip starting of the flow altogether. This was especially problematic if the flow in question was the infra flow, making it impossible to control the runtime from the iPaaS portal.
- Fixed clearing of auto-started flows, when the runtime was given the shutdown command immediately after starting. This should solve a rare issue where after a restart the runtime would not start any flows, making it impossible to control the runtime from the iPaaS portal.
- The startup process of the runtime will now stop when the runtime is given the shutdown command. Previously, the startup process would still continue when attempting a shutdown during startup, resulting in unexpected behaviour.

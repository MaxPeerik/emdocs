Release with retry behaviour, support for UTF with BOM, HTTPS web service hosting, new JMS features and library/technology updates.
## New features
- Added support for configuration of sophisticated retry scenarios on nearly all flow endpoints using the Spring Retry project.
- Added support for the following custom character encodings: (##46059)
  - x-UTF-8-BOM (eight-bit Unicode Transformation Format, with byte-order mark)
  - x-UTF-16BE-BOM (sixteen-bit Unicode Transformation Format, big-endian byte order, with byte-order mark)
- Added support for SSL select channel selector to Jetty Web Server, enabling hosting of web services using the HTTPS protocol. Also supports 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual authentication).
- New features added to the JMS messaging infrastructure layer:
  - failover using replication is now supported in addition to failover using a shared-store
  - message redelivery can now be configured to use an exponentially increasing delay between attempts
  - 2-way SSL (i.e. mutual authentication) is now supported for securing connections between servers and clients
  - the local address/port used by clients when creating outgoing connections to JMS servers can now be explicitly set, which can be useful to solve firewall issues in specific deployment scenarios
  - this new version is backwards compatible with the previous version, but not forwards compatible: this means that old JMS clients can still connect to new JMS servers, but new JMS clients cannot connect to old JMS servers
- Added functionality to Mendix 3 & 4 runtime modules for delayed auto-loading of configurations (#48315); see the documentation of the new constant EMagiz_Runtime.AutoLoadDelay on how to enable this. Auto-loading configurations with a delay can be useful in cases where Mendix must be fully started before loading the eMagiz flows, for example when an eMagiz message flow calls a web service hosted in the same Mendix runtime.

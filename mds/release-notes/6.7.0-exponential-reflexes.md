Release that improves the graphical representations of the bus and updates the way alerts are created. In addition, this release includes several small improvements and tackles some minor issues.

Please note that in Alerting (under Manage in the menu), the triggers are updated. While many triggers could be automatically converted, the old monitoring triggers are deprecated. You will have to manually recreate their equivalents in the new trigger style. It is advised to not copy the triggers literally only, but also analyse the goal of the trigger. Deprecated triggers, that are not manually converted before the next release, will still be converted automatically, which might lead to unexpected alerts.
## New features
- Added component JMS inbound channel adapter. Receives JMS messages from the specified destination at the connection created by the connection factory. Note that this inbound channel adapter is a polling consumer. This should only be used in situations where polling is done relatively infrequently and timeliness is not important. For all other situations (a vast majority of JMS-based use-cases), the JMS message driven channel adapter is a better option. Also note that in contrast to the JMS message driven channel adapter, this channel adapter does not register a consumer on the JMS destination that is always present. This means that you cannot detect any "missing consumers" on JMS queues/topics when using these polling consumers (although when using a caching connection factory that caches consumers combined with a low polling interval, the behaviour will appear to be the same).
- Highlighting: In the capture phase of the ILM, the flow of a message type can now be made clear by clicking on the label of the message type. By clicking on a system, all flows connected to that system are highlighted.
## Major changes
- Alerting: Revised the way alerts are generated, and thus the way triggers have to be set. It should now be easier to set new monitoring triggers, especially to check for missing data measurements and log entries. The new monitoring alerts use exponential moving averages (EMA), which helps to filter out noise in the measurements. This is also in preparation of the migration to a single portal for testing/acceptance/production.
## Minor changes
- Improved looks of graphical representations of the bus (#155087)
- Added folding of systems in the graphical representations of message buses
- In the topology of the bus, containers are can now be double-clicked to reach the infra-flow or the JMS-server of the container.
- Deployment dashboard: Added the option to set a "ready-for" environment
- Triggers set to monitor "all objects", now only evaluate all object of their own environment. This avoids many unwanted alerts. (#156443)
## Bug fixes
- Customer admin is able to add new system codes to mappings again (#155446)
- Message tracking: Fixed a bug where tracked message were not always showing.
- A partner admin can change their own password again. (#155449)

Release that adds several new components, leads to improved performance of the portal, as well as solving issues originating from the update to Mendix 5.
## New features
- To avoid badly-behaved configurations having a negative impact on performance for others, we may limit the amount of monitoring data per customer accepted by the portal each day. Through the alert and notification system, it is possible to subscribe to the "data limit reached" alert-tag. In that case, you know when to adjust a misbehaving configuration. Note: This only affects monitoring data sent to the portal. In no way does it influence operational messages going through your runtimes.
## Major changes
- Added components to flow designer for new runtime (3.20.0).
## Minor changes
- Minor improvements to the graphical message bus (#76350,76065,76068)
- Name of both output and input definition visible in mapping screen. (#125433,125437)
- Minor improvements in mapping and definition.
  - Close button always visible in mapping screen (top right). (#63970,133615,76132)
- Deeplink to portal available in error mail, so you can easily view the complete error message in the portal.
- Performance improvements, especially in the flow designer (#131418)
- Default sorting on message history in error messages show last component for a message first. (#134457)
- To improve performance, the data for statistics of queues are now recorded only once every two minutes. This is most clearly visible in the "data measurements" graph in the JMS queue statistics for the flow manager, where in the new situation, there are 30 measurements per hour. Note: This may have effect on your alerts.

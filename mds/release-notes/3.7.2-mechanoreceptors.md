Second maintenance release in the eMagiz 3.7.x line.
## Minor changes
- Added new property reconnect on failover to JMS caching connection factory, which can be used to suppress client side reconnection attempts when a successful failover on the server side has occurred.
- Added two new embedded XSLTs for common operations on web service messages (extracting the message from the request and generating an 'empty' response).

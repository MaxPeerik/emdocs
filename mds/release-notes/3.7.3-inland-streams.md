Third maintenance release in the eMagiz 3.7.x line.
## Minor changes
- Replaced property use unsynchronized appender of the log appender channel adapter with the new property appender type: this adds the option to choose for an asynchronous appender, which can be useful in situations where the downstream message flow is a bit unreliable by queuing the logging events. This queuing behaviour can be tweaked with the new properties async queue size and async discarding threshold.
- Added new property retry interval to log appender channel adapter, enabling the user to specify retry behaviour if this appender cannot send logging events to the downstream message flow. Previously the appender just shut itself down to prevent cascading failures (this is now the default), but by specifying a retry interval the appender will periodically try to startup again.
- Update to Logback 1.0.9
